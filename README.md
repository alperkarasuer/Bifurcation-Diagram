# Bifurcation-Diagram

This repository is a collection of MATLAB scripts designed to generate bifurcation diagrams, a crucial tool in the study of nonlinear dynamical systems. Developed as part of the coursework for PHYS435 Int. To Nonlinear Dynamical Systems and Chaos course. This project aims to visualise the qualitative behaviour of equilibrium points as a parameter within the system is varied.

## Features
* **Pitchfork Bifurcation Diagram:** Fully implemented and capable of generating pitchfork bifurcation diagrams for suitable equations, also identifying stability of equilibrium points.
* **Saddle-Node Bifurcation Diagram:** Not fully implemented. This part of the project aims to visualise saddle-node bifurcations.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome, especially in completing the saddle-node bifurcation diagram functionality. If you'd like to contribute, please fork the repository and create a pull request with your proposed changes.
